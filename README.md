# reddit-parse\
This is a simple data exploration project. The project was done with the aim of learning how to 
use the Python programming language and its libraries for data research. It includes research 
on the social network "Reddit", namely several scripts for parsing the site and one Jupiter notebook with research.
You can parse other subreddits using "scriptSelenium.py" and "scrtiptBs4.py" these scripts extract similar data but just use different libraries.
